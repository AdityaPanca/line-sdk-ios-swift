/**
 A set of methods that your delegate object could implement to receive share view controller events when user interacts
 with the interface.

 ## Overview

 The methods of this protocol notify your delegate when there is an event happens in the owner `ShareViewController`.
 It is not a must that you provide a delgate object for `ShareViewController`. However, to know events like loading
 fails, user cancellation or message sent successfully, you need to implement the related methods.
*/
public protocol ShareViewControllerDelegate: AnyObject {

    /// Tells the delegate that the loading process fails for a specified type with an error.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - controller: The controller object managing the share interface.
    ///   - shareType: The type which fails to load.
    ///   - error: A value contains information about the detail of the error.
    ///
    /// The `ShareViewController` will automatically load the user's friends and groups list, and use these data to
    /// fill up the table view respectively. If an error happens during the loading process, this delegate method will
    /// be called.
    ///
    /// You can check the `error` parameter to determine what to do next. Usually, the loading failure could be caused
    /// by a bad networking connection, invalid server responses or an API error. The `ShareViewController` does not
    /// provide a way to retry the loading, so you may need to dismiss the current share view controller and let your
    /// user to choose to present a new share view controller or discard the sharing action.
    ///
    /// This method can be called multiple times, since there are multiple list loading in the `ShareViewController`.
    /// Each invocation contains a `shareType` parameter. For a single `shareType`, this method will be called no
    /// more than once.
    ///
    /// See `LineSDKError` for more about handling the errors.
    ///

    ///
    /// - Parameter controller: The controller object managing the share interface.
    ///
    /// This method is called when the user cancels sharing action by tapping the "Close" button in the sharing UI.
    ///
    /// Your delegateâ€™s implementation of this method should dismiss the share view controller by calling the
    /// `dismiss(animated:completion:)` method on either the `controller` or on its presenting view controller.
    ///
    /// If you didn't set a delegate object for `ShareViewController` or you didn't implement this method in the
    /// delegate object, the `ShareViewController` will be dismissed with animation for you.

    /// Tells the delegate that the message sending fails due to an error.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - controller: The controller object managing the share interface.
    ///   - messages: An array of `Message` values which should be sent.
    ///   - targets: An array of `ShareTarget` values to which the `messages` should be sent to.
    ///   - error: A value contains information about the detail of the error.

    /// This method is called when the user taps the "Send" button but an error happens during the network request
    /// for sending the messages.
    ///
    /// It means there is a problem when connecting to server, or the server refuses the sending request. There is no
    /// message sent to selected users or groups.
    ///
    /// Check the `error` parameter to know the detail about the error. You may also want to dismiss the current share
    /// view controller and show an error message to the user. See `LineSDKError` for more about handling the errors.
    ///
    /// - Note:
    /// By default, when the message sent and the response received, the share view controller will be dismissed
    /// automatically, unless you implemented the `shareViewControllerShouldDismissAfterSending(_:)` method
    /// in the delegate object and returns `false` there. You can implement that and return `false`, then dismiss the
