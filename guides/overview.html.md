The LINE SDK Swift lets you integrate LINE into your iOS app to create a more engaging experience for your users. It is a modern pure Swift implementation for LINE APIs with opening in mind from the first minute.

## Features

After installing LINE SDK Swift, you will be provided with the following features.

### Authentication with LINE Login

Allowing your users to log in to your service with their LINE accounts. With the help of LINE SDK Swift, it was never easier to integrate LINE Login into your app. Your users will automatically log in to your app without entering their LINE credentials if they are already logged in to LINE on their iOS devices. This brings you a good way to have users trying your app quickly without registration.

### Identifying Your User

Once authorized, you could identify your users by accessing their profile in LINE. It saves you the cost of building your own user system since you could trust and rely on LINE's account management.
