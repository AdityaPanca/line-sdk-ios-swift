#### Can I use advanced features like Graph APIs and Message Sending?

Sorry, but not currently. These features are now <b>still in closed beta</b>. They are only for some internal partner using, and not yet prepared for the public. Now, <b>we do not accept any applications for them yet</b>. Please keep an eye on it and we will inform you if the state changes in future.
